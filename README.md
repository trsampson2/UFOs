# UFOs

## Overview

The client, Dana, collected years worth of data about UFO sightings.  She collected data from multiple cities, states, and countries to compile a comprehensive database of UFO sightings.  A webpage and dynamic table was created to show this data.  A user will be able to filter through the date, city, state, country, and shape.  

## Results
Dana can deploy this website and have users filter their desired search by date, city, state, country, and shape. The user just has to enter in what they would like to search.  For example, if the user wants to look at a certain city.  They just have to enter in the city in all lower case letters.  If there were any sightings in that citty, they will appear.  Cities and states must be entered in all lower case letters.  The date must be in "M/DD/YYYY" format.  Shapes include: 
 - sphere, 
 - fireball, 
 - triangle, 
 - light, 
 - formation,
 - disk,
 - chevron, 
 - rectangle,
 -   
 - unknown, and

## Summary

The webpage does have limiations.  One of its drawbacks is that the data can't be sorted by the fields.  For example, if a user wanted to see all the data but sorted by the states in alphbetical order.  
To make this webpage, Dana could add a way to sort the data by the columns.  Also, the druration is in varying formats, for example 5 mins., 1 min, a few min.) If this could be standardized and a search or sort could be done on durations.
